# Car Service
The project is to book a service for car maintenance and provide booking for it. The project is built on Maven. It is using SMTP protocol and other basic java functionalities.

In this particular project we are going to provide the functionality of car service and maintenance
on request.
The scopes of the project are:-
• The user can authenticate by single sign-on using “OAUTH”.
• The new user can first register with credentials or can authorize himself by using single
sign-on.
• The registered user can then search for the city he/she is living in and thus can provide
with the name of the company of whose vendor he/she is looking for.
• The searching for a particular car company vendor can also be utilized without creating
an account thus saving users’ time if there is no vendor in his/her city.
• After that the user can generate a request for booking a car service by using multiple
options(multiple vendors in that particular city) by choosing from the authorized vendor’s
list being provided thereby.
• The lists of the vendor are predefined and the user can also rate according to the service.
• The car company will get a notification for the request with an OTP via mail.
• Then the vendor will send a person who will confirm that OTP and prove his authenticity
to the user.
• After the service done the message will be delivered from vendor to the user.
Future Aspect:
• The payment option can be used in the project as future aspect.
• The vendor’s lists will be updated regularly based on the new vendors in a particular city.
